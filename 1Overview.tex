\section{Overview of the Workshop}\label{Overview}
%\fix{editor: Rainer}

\noindent SWHEPPS~\cite{workshopindico},  the Strategic Workshop on High Energy Particle Physics in Switzerland, was a 2.5 day workshop that took place from 8-10 June 2016 at 
Seminarhotel Aegerisee.   It was  modeled as a plenary session-only retreat of primarily senior CH researchers and PIs engaged in CHIPP~\cite{chipp} pillar 1 activities, 
i.e. research at the high energy and low energy frontier (an introduction to the pillar structure of CHIPP can be found in the CHIPP roadmap~\cite{roadmap}). The aim  of the workshop
 was to take stock of the present state of the field in order to identify key elements influencing the strategy of Swiss researchers active in pillar 1 research activities for the next 5-15 years or
 - failing that - define milestones when identifying those elements should become clearer. The workshop should furthermore serve as a kick-off meeting to start  process of editing a
 CHIPP whitepaper on future pillar 1 activities in order to  complement similar documents pertaining to the neutrino pillar~\cite{neutrinowhitepaper} and the astroparticle 
  pillar~\cite{astroparticlepillarwhitepaper} in time for the Update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics  of the  CERN council~\cite{europeanstrategy}.

\noindent The workshop consisted of 28 plenary talks of 25 minutes length and 5 minutes discussion  and three 90-minute discussion sessions. 11 external speakers were invited to offer
their perspective from outside Switzerland. Figure~\ref{fig:timetable} shows the timetable.

 \noindent The convenors (mentioned as section editors in the session summaries) were asked to select and invite speakers for their session primarily from the CH community with the possibility 
 to invite an external keynote speaker (with paid expenses) that could help to shape and sharpen the discussion.   A salient feature of the workshop structure was the "embedding" of 
 phenomenological contributions by theorists to otherwise experimental sessions  to highlight the theory-experiment interplay.

 \noindent This summary write up (in its current preliminary form) should for the time being  be considered as a CHIPP-internal document and as work in progress. The intention of the organizing
 committee (consisting of F. Canelli, G. Colangelo, G. Dissertori, B. Kilminster, G. Iacobucci,  T. Nakada and R. Wallny) is that the document serves as a starting point for editing
 the pillar 1 whitepaper. The convenors have kindly agreed to act as editors for the pillar 1 whitepaper as well.  The organizers wish to thank all speakers and convenors as well as the
 secretarial staff (C. Keufer-Platz, G. Amstutz of IPP ETHZ) and and CHIPP (M. T\"urler) for their support. The workshop was financially supported by the participants' registration fee as well
 as a grant of SCNAT and contributions by CHIPP,  the Univ. of Geneva, the  Univ. of Zurich and by ETH Zurich. This financial support is gratefully acknowledged.
